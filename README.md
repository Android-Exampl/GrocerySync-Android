## Grocery Sync for Couchbase Lite Android

This is a simple example of using the [Couchbase Lite Android](https://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-lite-android) mobile database framework.
 
The "use case" is a shared grocery list where all devices using the application would see a mirror of the grocery list.  Any changes will automatically background sync with a Sync Gateway running in the cloud.  (bi-directional)
 
## Prequisites

* Install [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html) version 0.1.3 or later with Android Support Repository and Google Repository.
* Install [Sync Gateway](https://github.com/couchbaselabs/sync_gateway).

## Getting the code


```
$ git clone git@github.com:couchbaselabs/GrocerySync-Android.git
$ git submodule init && git submodule update
```

_Note_: it is important to leave the directory name as the default, otherwise it could confuse the Android Studio IDE

## Configure Android SDK location

Gradle (the build system used by Studio) needs to know where your Android SDK is, otherwise it won't be able to build anything.

* First the local.properties file must be created so that Android knows where your SDK is: `$ cp local.properties.example local.properties`. 
* If you are on OSX and installed Android Studio to the default location, you should be ok with the defaults in `local.properties`
* Otherwise, open `local.properties` and make sure it points to the Android SDK on your system.  Change the path as needed.



## Import the project in Android Studio

* Choose File / Import project
* Check "Auto-import"
* Leave "Use default gradle wrapper"
* After your open the project, it should look like [this](http://cl.ly/image/2E3T1T2q261E), and the imports should be ok, as shown [here](http://cl.ly/image/2m1a1K3n0c1V)

## Enable Android Support Repository and Google Repository

Open the Android SDK from Android Studio (Tools->Android->SDK Manager) and make sure that the Android Support Repository and Google Repository items are installed.

This is needed in order to resolve this dependency on the android support library:

```
dependencies {
    compile 'com.android.support:support-v4:13.0.0'
    ...
}
```


## Configuring a database

GrocerySync is designed to sync all of its data to a Sync Gateway instance, so it needs a valid URL.

* Configure the hardcoded DATABASE_URL in the MainActivity.java file to the URL of your Sync Gateway instance.  (there is also a value in the Settings that can be used, which will override the hardcoded default)  
* Create a DB named `grocery-test` on the Sync Gateway instance.

## Run the app via Android Studio

* Run it using the "play" or "debug" buttons in the UI

## Run via Gradle

* Run the android emulator
* Run `./gradlew clean && ./gradlew installDebug`
* Switch to the emulator and you should have a new app called GrocerySync-Android
* Tap it to open the app

## Where to go from here: creating your own Couchbase-Lite app

See the [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-lite-android/wiki/Getting-Started).

## Deviations from the iOS version
 
Android typically uses a long-click to trigger additional action, as opposed to swipe-to-delete, so this convention was followed.
 
## Known Issues
 
We currently do not handle the Sync URL changing at runtime (if you change it you have to restart the app)
